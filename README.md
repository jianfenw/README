# README
This project gives a demo about the interesting README.md file. You may notice that you should have a README.md file, but do you know how to write a better README.md file?<br>
README.md is a text file in Markdown format. Markdown is created to easily edit your blog. However, the Markdown used by github is a modified version of the standard Markdown and is called Github Flavored Markdown (GFM).

Create a new project and write your own README.md for your project! You can even edit it online and see the changes immediately (click the "Preview" bottom).<br>

# How to craete a title
Large title:<br>
\# + your words

Middle title:<br>
your words<br>
\----

You may notice there is a line under the words. It means you have created a new title. You can also create a line to seperate paragraghs by type a "#".

# How to edit text

## Linefeed

Typing a 'Enter' does not make any change. Unlike a normal texteditor, you have to use \<br> for linefeed.

## Single line text

Add two 'Tab' to make a single line text.

## Highlight words

If you want to highlight some words in your README.md, you can use \`\` to wrap the words that you'd like to highlight.

## External weblink

[ your words]( your weblink "your mouseover")
